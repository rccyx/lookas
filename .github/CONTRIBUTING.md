# Contributing

This project is optimized for self-directed contributors who are comfortable reading code, understanding intent, and acting without supervision.

If you’re here to use it, welcome.
If you’re here to improve it, even better.

## How this project works

- Pull requests are the primary mechanism for changes.
- Issues are used to document bugs, gaps, or edge cases.

You do not need prior approval to fix something. If you can address it, submit a pull request.

## Fixing bugs

If you identify a bug and can fix it, open a pull request and explain the change clearly.

If a related issue exists, link it.
If no issue exists, the pull request itself is sufficient.

Prior approval is not required.

## Communication

All technical discussion happens in public issues or pull requests so it can be reviewed, referenced, and acted upon by everyone.

## Forking

If this operating model aligns with how you work, contributions are welcome.

If not, you are free to fork the project and proceed independently.
