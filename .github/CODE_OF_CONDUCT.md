This Code of Conduct exists to keep interactions clean, focused, and workable.

So be cool and be clear. Get things done.

## Scope

This applies to all interactions related to this repository, including issues, pull requests, discussions, reviews, and any project-adjacent coordination spaces.

## Expected behavior

Communicate clearly and in good faith. Keep discussions technical, concrete, and actionable. Disagree without being disrespectful. Respect other people’s time.

When making claims, provide grounding such as links, code, reproduction steps, or specifications.

Directness is welcome. Disrespect is not.

## Unacceptable behavior

The following behaviors are not acceptable in this repository or any project-related discussion space:

Personal attacks, insults, harassment, or discriminatory behavior.
Threats, doxxing, intimidation, or encouragement of harm.

Deliberate misrepresentation of facts, impersonation, or false claims of affiliation, authority, or expertise.
Persistent non-constructive argumentation or discussion patterns that prioritize winning over resolution.

Reopening settled decisions under new issues, pull requests, or reframed questions after a clear decision has been made.
Attempts to route around maintainer decisions through escalation, tagging, back-channeling, or social pressure.

Derailing discussions, flooding threads with low-signal content, bikeshedding, or using issues or pull requests for off-topic or performative purposes.
Using this repository for SEO manipulation, backlink insertion, marketing, or self-promotion.

Support requests presented as bugs or issues, vague problem reports that offload investigation work onto maintainers, or demands for debugging of personal environments.

Requests that pressure maintainers into timelines, decisions, emotional engagement, implied responsibility for third party usage or breakage, or unpaid consulting.

Any behavior that materially increases maintenance burden without contributing corresponding value.
